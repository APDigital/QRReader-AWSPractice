# QRReader-AWSPractice
QR Reader app that saves and retrieves data via AWS 

This project will allow me to practice using AWS for data storage and hopefully allow me to explore the other capabilities of infrastructure as service solutions 

I hope to continue development for this solution to eventually build a mobile app capable of running comparisons on everyday items using this solution as a backend service or API
